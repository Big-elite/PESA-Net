# Implementation for PESA-Net
The code is about my core model (Including, the PESA-Net architecture, PESA Block, SSEU Module, weighted_8points, residual computation, et al.). we will upload all the code after the paper is accepted. ^_^

**PESA-Net is very effective!!!**

As shown above, comparing with other state-of-the-art approaches on YFCC100M unknown scenes, PESA-Net introduces very few additional parameters and negligible computations while bringing notable performance gain.
